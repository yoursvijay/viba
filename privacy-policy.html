    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Generally, we use Personal Information to establish and enhance our relationship with our users through four main categories: (1) Communication; (2) Optimization; (3) Advertising; and (4) Sharing Features. Below, we provide some specific examples of how we use the Personal Information and other information we collect.</p>
    <h3>3.1 Communication and Responding to Requests
    </h3>
    <p>We use your information, including Personal Information to provide you with customer support, process transactions, respond to users' requests, send newsletters and updates, send special offers and advertisements, seek your opinions, and feedback, and connect users to The VIBA Sites, Applications and/or Services.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Optimization
    </h3>
    <p>We use your information, including Personal Information, behavioral metrics, and other non-personally identifiable information to operate, provide, improve, and maintain our Sites and Services, to develop new products and services, to prevent abuse and fraud, to personalize and display advertisements and other content for you, and for other administrative and internal business purposes.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Sharing Features
    </h3>
    <p>We use your information, including Personal Information and any other information you submit directly or through passive means to provide you with various ways to connect and share content. For example, we may provide you with the opportunity to email a link to certain content to another person. To use this feature, we may require you to provide certain Personal Information including your email address and the email address of each person to whom you send the link.</p>
    <p>We also may allow you to share links to content with users of various third-party services (e.g., social networking, search and sharing services). When sharing links using one of these third-party services, if you are not already logged in to the third-party service, you will need to supply login credentials for it. If you are not a registered user of the third-party service, you will need to sign up for it. You are supplying the registration information or login credentials for the third-party service directly to that third party, and not to us. By using any of these third-party services to share links to content, you permit us to access, use and disclose any information relating to your account on each such third-party service (such as your username and profile information) that is available to us through the third-party service, including through its application programming interface (API) pursuant to this Policy.</p>
    <p>More Specifically, The VIBA Sites, Application and/or Services may use interfaces with social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and others. If you choose to "like" or share information from The VIBA Sites, Application and/or Services through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your site visit to your personally identifiable information resulting in the public display of the same.</p>
    <h2>4. When We Reveal Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share Personal Information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy.</p>
    <h3>4.1 Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We may provide Personal Information to third parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, customer service, maintenance, security, data analysis, email transmission, beta testing, or data hosting) on our behalf. Additionally, some third-party service providers may collect information, including Personal Information, on our behalf. For example, we may use a third-party provider to assist us in utilizing data monitoring and scouring technologies to obtain and transmit data on users of illegal copies of some of our products. Data collection is not performed on users of legally licensed products from The VIBA and its authorized distributors. If you are using an illegal copy of our software and do not consent to the collection and transmission of such data (including to the United States), cease using the illegal version and contact us or one of our authorized distributors to obtain a legally licensed copy of the product.</p>
    <p>Whenever possible, we require such third parties to only collect and use Personal Information in accordance with this Policy, to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such Personal Information, and for no purpose other than providing us with our requested services</p>
    <h3>4.2 Partners</h3>
    <p>When you visit or use a part of any website, mobile application, or other consumer product that is co-branded or that is a part of a joint promotion involving TechSmith and one or more third parties (each a "Co-Branded Party"), you are providing and consenting to provide and are transmitting your Personal Information and other information provided to, or collected, or obtained by TechSmith and any Co-Branded Parties involved, to TechSmith and each of the Co-Branded Parties without any other notice or further consent. Please note that we do not control any Co-Branded Parties' use or treatment of information you provide to them, and you should consult each of their privacy policies or any separate Co-Branded privacy policy posted on or linked from the Co-Branded site to determine your rights with respect to their use and treatment of your information. You will need to communicate with us and each Co-Branded Party directly, as applicable, if you decide you no longer wish to receive communications or if you wish to change any information you have supplied.
    </p>
    <h3>4.3 Legal requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose Personal Information if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena, warrant, or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by national security, law enforcement requirements, statute, government regulation, or law. Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent violation of our Terms of Use or End User License Agreements, or our other agreements; take precautions against liability; protect our rights, property, or safety, or those of a partner, any individual or the general public; maintain and protect the security and integrity of our Sites, Application and/or Services or infrastructure; protect ourselves and our Sites, Application and/or Services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; investigate and defend ourselves against third party claims or allegations; or assist government regulatory agencies.</p>
    <h2>5. Third Party Advertising Technologies</h2>

These companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior. These companies may use information about user behavior in order to provide customized advertisements across various services and products. In the course of providing these services, products or placing advertisements, these third-party companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer and may record information to these cookies based upon your activities on any of our Sites, Application and/or Services and on third party websites.

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Submitting Personal Information<br/>
      If you do not want to submit Personal Information that is necessary to provide or use our Sites, application and/or Services or to fulfill your request, you will not be able to access and/or participate in certain Sites, application and/or Services.

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures, including the implementation and maintenance of physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, in an effort to assure the security, integrity, and accuracy of all Personal Information that we collect. Our efforts include procedures designed to avoid unauthorized access, alteration, loss, misuse, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information considering the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>

      <p>You may view, correct, amend, or delete the Personal Information The VIBA stores about you where it is inaccurate or if you believe the Personal Information has been processed contrary to the terms of this Policy except to the extent where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than yours would be violated. Most of your Personal Information may be accessed and corrected by simply logging into your account and accessing your profile. If you wish to obtain a report of the Personal Information. The VIBA has about you, please send us a written request at the address set forth in this Policy.</p>
